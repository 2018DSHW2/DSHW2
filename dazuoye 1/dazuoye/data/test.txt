1,"the metabolic world of escherichia coli is not small","To elucidate the organizational and evolutionary principles of the metabolism of living organisms, recent studies have addressed the graph-theoretic analysis of large biochemical networks responsible for the synthesis and degradation of cellular building blocks [Jeong, H., Tombor, B., Albert, R., Oltvai, Z. N. \& Barab\{\'a\}si, A. L. (2000) Nature 407, 651-654; Wagner, A. \& Fell, D. A. (2001) Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. B 268, 1803-1810; and Ma, H.-W. \& Zeng, A.-P. (2003) Bioinformatics 19, 270-277]. In such studies, the global properties of the network are computed by considering enzymatic reactions as links between metabolites. However, the pathways computed in this manner do not conserve their structural moieties and therefore do not correspond to biochemical pathways on the traditional metabolic map. In this work, we reassessed earlier results by digitizing carbon atomic traces in metabolic reactions annotated for Escherichia coli. Our analysis revealed that the average path length of its metabolism is much longer than previously thought and that the metabolic world of this organism is not small in terms of biosynthesis and degradation."
2,"reverse engineering of biological complexity","Advanced technologies and biology have extremely different physical implementations, but they are far more alike in systems-level organization than is widely appreciated. {C}onvergent evolution in both domains produces modular architectures that are composed of elaborate hierarchies of protocols and layers of feedback regulation, are driven by demand for robustness to uncertain environments, and use often imprecise components. {T}his complexity may be largely hidden in idealized laboratory settings and in normal operation, becoming conspicuous only when contributing to rare cascading failures. {T}hese puzzling and paradoxical features are neither accidental nor artificial, but derive from a deep and necessary interplay between complexity and robustness, modularity, feedback, and fragility. {T}his review describes insights from engineering theory and practice that can shed some light on biological complexity."
3,"exploring complex networks","The study of networks pervades all of science, from neurobiology to statistical physics. The most basic issues are structural: how does one characterize the wiring diagram of a food web or the {I}nternet or the metabolic network of the bacterium {E}scherichia coli? {A}re there any unifying principles underlying their topology? {F}rom the perspective of nonlinear dynamics, we would also like to understand how an enormous network of interacting dynamical systems-be they neurons, power stations or lasers-will behave collectively, given their individual dynamics and coupling architecture. {R}esearchers are only now beginning to unravel the structure and dynamics of complex networks."
